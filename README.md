# FS-Overrun
Overrun is a long-term zombie survival coop scenario for Arma 3 for up to 20 players. Completely created from the ground up by UselessFodder in SQF.

Storyline:
The UN Bioterrorism Response Team (BRT) has been cut off as the zombie virus ravages across the land. The team must endure, survive, and cleanse their way across the island, eradicating this bio menace once and for all...

Features:
- 30-40 zones to fight and cleanse the zombie hordes
- Side objectives within each zone
- Persistent saves between play sessions
- Vehicle and equipment unlock system
- Custom 'DECON' wave defense event
- Multi-stage Campaign Finale Event
- Completely custom arsenal creation script
- Custom BRT Patches created by SlugFox
- Zeus capability for hosts & logged in admins
- The only multi-session horror scenario in Arma!

NOTE: This persistent mission was inspired by the amazing KP-Liberation, but diverges from that scenario in significant ways and does not utilize a single line of their code. The focus here is on the tension of clearing a dark, lamp-lit village on foot by flashlight, waiting to hear the footsteps of the infected just around the next turn... There are no tanks, planes, and indirect fire. No one is coming to save your team: You are on your own and must cleanse this island with your own grit and ingenuity. I hope you enjoy the experience...

This mission has been in the making for 3 years. Special Thanks to my community, the FoddSquad, for suffering through countless hours of tests. I owe a debt of gratitude to every single person who has come out to shoot zombies, get their radio changed by ghosts, and watch the DECON truck get yeeted across Malden. Thank you.
